# Air Pollution Prediction Model

The Air Pollution Prediction Model is a sophisticated solution employing machine learning to predict levels of air pollution. By harnessing the capabilities of `statsmodels` and in-depth data analytics, this model offers a tool for environmental agencies, researchers, and governments to anticipate air pollution spikes and take corrective actions.
